							<p>Bugatti has been making one of a kind and custom made cars for its ultra 
								wealthy clients for more than 100 years. The average Bugatti buyer owns 
								roughly 42 vehicles, five homes, three private jets, three helicopters and a 
								yacht, according to Bugatti. 
							</p>

							<p>"When you are wealthy, the thing you want most after your wealth is to feel
							special and unique- and someone who pays $18 million for a car gets to claim
							'I bought the most expensive car ever, see how special I am.'", said Karl Brauer,
							an analyst for Autotrader.
							</p>

							<p>After becoming a part of the VW Group in 1998, the company scrapped custom models in
								favour of more mass produced, but still incredibly limited, super cars.
							</p>

							<p>In the years that followed, the company produced 450 Veyron super cars launched
							in 2005 and recently completed 200 of 500 planned Bugatti Chirons, which starts at $3 millions.
